# Freezeout Poker Cards

This crate implements types for poker cards and provides functionality for
dealing, sampling, and iterating over cards in a deck.

With the **egui** feature enabled it exports texture types to paint cards in an egui
application, see the [board](../eval/examples/board.rs) example in the
[eval](../eval/) crate for a simple egui app that uses the textures.
